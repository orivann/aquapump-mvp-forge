# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future development, deployment, and operational plans for this project.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Complete)

- [x] Codebase organization
- [x] Docker containerization (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing Docker images to ECR (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- [x] Initial documentation

## Phase 2: Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - Implement a testing framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest, React Testing Library).
  - Write unit tests for critical components and utility functions.
  - Add integration tests for user flows (e.g., navigation, form submissions).
- **CI Enhancements:**
  - Add a `test` stage to the GitHub Actions workflow to run all tests before the build and push steps. A failed test run should fail the workflow.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
  - Introduce an E2E testing framework like Playwright or Cypress to test the application in a real browser.

## Phase 3: Staging and Production Deployment

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - Use Terraform or AWS CDK to define and manage the cloud infrastructure (VPC, ECS/Fargate cluster, Load Balancer, ECR).
- **Staging Environment:**
  - Create a staging environment that mirrors production.
  - Deploy the `latest` Docker image from ECR to the staging environment automatically on every merge to `main`.
- **Production Deployment Strategy:**
  - Implement a manual approval step in the GitHub Actions workflow for production deployments.
  - Use a Git-tagging strategy (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to trigger production deployments. The workflow will deploy the corresponding versioned Docker image from ECR.
- **Cloud Service:**
  - **Option A (Serverless):** Deploy the container to **AWS Fargate**. This is a cost-effective and low-maintenance option for running containers without managing servers.
  - **Option B (Orchestration):** Deploy to an **Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)** cluster for more complex, large-scale applications requiring advanced orchestration.

## Phase 4: Monitoring, Logging, and Scaling

- **Logging:**
  - Configure the application and infrastructure to send logs to **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Set up **Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards** to monitor key metrics (CPU/Memory utilization, request counts, error rates).
  - Create CloudWatch Alarms to notify the team of any issues (e.g., high error rates, service downtime).
- **Scaling:**
  - Configure **Auto Scaling** for the ECS/Fargate service to automatically adjust the number of running containers based on traffic and resource utilization.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
  - Use **Amazon CloudFront** in front of the application's Load Balancer to cache static assets and serve content faster to users globally.
